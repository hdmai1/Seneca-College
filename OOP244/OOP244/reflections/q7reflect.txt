Quiz 7 V1 reflection.

1- convert the above search function to a template so it can work for any type of array.

What was wrong: I have set numberOfSamples and foundIndex as T, which are incorrect, because we are using template for all of the functions, numberofSamples and foundindex just work as a counter, there is nothing related to the template.

=> 
template <typename T>
bool search(T valToSearchFor, T samples[], int numberOfSamples, unsigned int& foundIndex) {
   unsigned int i;
   bool found = false;
   for (i = 0; !found && i < numberOfSamples; i++) {
      if (samples[i] == valToSearchFor) {
         foundIndex = i;
         found = true;
      }
   }
   return found;
}

2- Name all the capabilities your Template type should have so your function template can work with that type.
What was wrong: I have listed assignment operator, operator++ and operator< just because I have set numberOfSample and foundIndex as in template. So we just need ==operator when we compare samples[i] and valtoSearchFor (which can be any type), and a copy constructor.
=> We need == operator and copy constructor so that it can work with that type.
