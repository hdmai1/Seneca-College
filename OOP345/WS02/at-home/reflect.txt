Hi Prof,

I'm Huu Duc Mai, through out the workshop 2, I have learned how move and copy semantics work.

The reason for the significant time difference between copy and move operations is:

*With copy, you have to create the new instance and then assign values from old instance to new ones so it will take more time to get this done.

*With move operation, you just need to move data from one instance to another, so it will take less time.

Thank you,

Huu Duc Mai.
