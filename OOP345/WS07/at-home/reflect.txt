Hi Prof,

A. Through out Workshop 7, I have used these STL functions:
	1. std::for_each
	=> to loop through every element of the vector.
	2. std::accumulate
	=> to accumulate the values in a specific range and then return the result.
	3. std::sort
	=> to sort the elements of the vector in an ascending order.
	4. std::any_of
	=> to return true if there is at least 1 element of the vector is the same with the parameter.
	5. std::count_if
	=> to count the number of occurences of artists that satisfied the input condition.
	6. std::copy_if
	=>  copy the elements from 1 vector to another vector as long as those elements are satisfied the condition.
B. Advantages: Save time, avoid some possible errors (typo, hidden logics...)

C. In my opinion, I have included in the function that if the parameter contains anything different than "title", "album", or "length", the program will display an error and leave the collection unsorted.

Thank you,

Huu Duc Mai.
